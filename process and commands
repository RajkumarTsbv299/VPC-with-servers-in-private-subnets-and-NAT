To achieve the desired setup described in your scenario, you'll need to execute a series of steps in AWS using various services
such as EC2, VPC, Auto Scaling Groups, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, SCP, SSH, and Load Balancer. Below is an outline of the steps you need to follow:

---->Create a VPC with public and private subnets:
Choose two availability zones.
Create a VPC with CIDR block.
Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC.
Create a public subnet in each availability zone with a route table that routes traffic to the Internet Gateway.
Create a private subnet in each availability zone with a route table that routes traffic to a NAT Gateway.

---->Create an Auto Scaling Group in the private subnet:
Select the appropriate AMI for your instances.
Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic (e.g., SSH).
Set up an Auto Scaling Group with desired capacity, minimum and maximum size, and health check settings.
Ensure instances are launched in the private subnet.

---->Create a Bastion Host:
Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
Use a security group that allows SSH access from your IP address.
Assign an Elastic IP to the Bastion Host (optional but recommended for static access).
Configure SSH access using your .pem file.

---->Copy .pem file to Bastion Host using SCP:
Open terminal on your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing your .pem file.
Use SCP to securely copy the file to the Bastion Host:
command:
"scp -i /path/to/your/aws_login.pem /path/to/your/aws_login.pem ubuntu@bastion_public_ip:/home/ubuntu/"

---->SSH into Bastion Host and then into private instances:
SSH into the Bastion Host using the .pem file:
command:
"ssh -i /path/to/your/aws_login.pem ubuntu@bastion_public_ip"
From the Bastion Host, SSH into any private instance using its private IP:
command:
"ssh -i /path/to/your/aws_login.pem ubuntu@private_instance_private_ip"

---->Create files on the private instances:
Use commands like touch, echo, or text editors like vi or vim to create and
edit files on the private instances.

---->Run a Python server on one of the instances:
Navigate to the directory where your files are located.
Run the Python HTTP server:
command:
"python3 -m http.server 8000"

---->Create a Load Balancer:
Configure the Load Balancer with listeners (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
Specify the VPC and subnets.
Create a target group and register instances from your Auto Scaling Group.
Set up Security Groups:

Create a new security group for the Load Balancer that allows traffic on port 80 (or your desired port).
Allow SSH traffic from the Bastion Host's security group to the private instances.
By following these steps, you'll create a VPC with public and private subnets, set up an Auto Scaling Group for your private instances, 
create a Bastion Host for SSH access, copy files securely to the Bastion Host, and access the private instances through the Bastion Host. Finally, 
you'll configure a Load Balancer for distributing traffic and set up security groups to control network access.
