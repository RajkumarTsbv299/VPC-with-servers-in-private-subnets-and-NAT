------------------------------------------------->VPC-with-servers-in-private-subnets-and-NAT Gateway<-----------------------------------------------------

create the vpc by give configuration.
it will create the one public subnet and private subnet in two avaliability zones.
create auto scalling group in private subnet and provide created vpc and port that are require like ssh. Select instances in private instaces.
create the another instance seperatly that is bastian host form it we can login to private instances.
open the bastian ec2 and get the public ip adress.
use the scp command that is securely vopy command.
i am copying my pem file from my personal laptop to bastian ubuntu ec2 instances.
frist of all change directory to file location by using "cd" command.
Ubuntu commnad: "scp -i /Home/rajkumar/Downloads/aws_login.pem /Home/rajkumar/Downloads/aws_login.pem ubuntu@52.23.193.131"-->bastian public ip address:/home/ubuntu.
After Coping the file to Bastian Host, login to it by using command
Command: "ssh -i aws_login.pem ubuntu@52.23.193.131"-->public ip adress
for listing pem file in bastian host use "ls" command.
Next log into any of other instances in private network.
take the private id adress of anyone private instaces to login from bastian instance.
use command: "ssh -i aws_login.pem ubuntu@0.0.140.109-->private ip address.
you can able to login to private instance from bastian by using above command.
After that create files in that instace in Linux Command.
The "touch" command is used to create an empty file or update the timestamps of existing files. If the file doesn't exist, touch will create it.
You can also create a file and write content into it using the "echo" command and redirecting the output using > operator.
After running this command, you can type the content you want to add to the file. Press "Ctrl + D" to save and exit.
You can use text editors like "vi" or "vim" to create and edit files.
run the python server in instance
command: "python3 -m htto.server 8000".
create the load balancer with ipv4 and provide the vpc that created , avaliable for both avalibility zones.
Create the new security group that you can define your own port numbers. That allows ssh traffic and port 8000 trafic.
so load balancer will allow only when the security groups  allows traffic on the listener port..
you need to create a Target Group where you can define  which instances accessible
